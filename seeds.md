# Runs with different seeds

The dataset used to assess the variability with different random seeds, for consistency, was CHM-22-SIM.

Barplots below depict results on the training data of the mentioned dataset on 5 different random seeds.

There are no significant differences between runs. The most visible difference can be found in the third barplot, in which a blue component appears in the African population. This is probably caused by the presence of individuals laying in the border between African and West Asian ancestry, _e.g._ Mozabites.
