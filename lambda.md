# Effect of regularization parameter λ

All models were trained on the CHM-22-SIM dataset.

For a small value of λ the assignments are hard, and the performance of the algorithm degrades. On the other hand, if the value of λ is too large (Figure 8c), then the assignments are
not meaningful, with the probability distribution of the bottleneck tending to uniform.
