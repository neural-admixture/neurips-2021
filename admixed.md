# Results on admixed individuals

Following results have been obtained by running a network on unseen chromosome 22 data of Mexican-American (MXL, 118 samples) and Puerto Rican (PUR, 104 samples). The network was trained on CHM-22-SIM.

Amongst the Mexican-American samples, we observe mainly a red indigenous component (Native American - AMR) with also a blue and brown component (corresponding to West Asia - WAS and Europe - EUR, respectively). These two latter components likely originate in the immigration of Spanish, Moorish, and Sephardic Jewish individuals during the colonial period.

The Puerto Rican samples exhibit EUR, WAS, AFR (African) and AMR ancestry clusters. The additional AFR component corresponds to Afro-Puerto Rican individuals, and is likely linked to the presence of libertos during the Spanish conquest of the island, as well as the later introduction of West African slaves to the territory.
